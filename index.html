            <h1>ORIGAMI</h1>
            <h2>Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori 
                (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of 
                folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) 
                into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</h2>
